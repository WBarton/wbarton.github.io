While researching and working on a project for a client I have deided on a few things regrading responsive web design. This is my current opinion and no doubt it will change; as it often does.

Responsive web design is not the perfect method to take a website and make it look amazing for every device. It is used to bridge the gaps between viewport sizes, a lot like fluid layouts did except it is taken further.

We want to design websites that change depending on the width of the device it is viewed on not just for making a site that scales nicely for mobile devices.

**It is called responsive web design not mobile web design.**
