In a discussion with my supervisor we covered the problems with a much larger screen the example that was used throughout the discussion was an internet enabled TV in someones living room. The are sat much further away than someone sat at a desk in front of a monitor. This causes some issues with readabillity because the font size is to small reletive to the distance from the screen to the user.
