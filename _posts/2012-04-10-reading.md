For the next couple of days/week I have decided to apply my attentions to reading. My chosen area? Traditional layout design.

The top three books I am currently working my way through are:

*   *The Layout Book* — Gavin Ambrose and Paul Harris, 2007
*   *Making and Breaking the Grid* — Timothy Samara, 2002
*   *The Designer and the Grid* — Lucienne Robert and Julia Thrift, 2002

These three book are very detailed and between them cover most of the topic that I wanted to research. I want to supplement the findings from my research with some deconstructions of current design, especially web sites that claim to use and not to use grids.
