This evening I attended a talk by Dr. Vanessa Brown about visual research thinking as part of the MA generic lecture series.

She used her research as a vehicle to deliver the information about different research strategies. I have compressed my notes and I am adding some key points i wanted to keep here for later reference.

> **Visual Research Strategies:**  
> Reading for visual research  
> Classifying &#8211; grouping around ideas  
> quantifying &#8211; counting  
> Contextualising &#8211; looking beyond the image  
> Analysing  
> Reflecting  
> Don&#8217;t forget&#8230; randomising (it doesn&#8217;t have to be in that order).

There were also some good pointers for semiotic analysis which are:

> <div>
>   Always frame the article with a genre for example an advert, a painting, a magazine cover.<br /> Denotation: Contents of the image &#8211; list of contents<br /> Connotation: What the content suggests separately and together.
> </div>
