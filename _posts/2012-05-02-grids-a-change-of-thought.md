<blockquote>
  <p>For some graphic designers, it has become an unquestioned part of the working process that yield precision, order, and clarity.</p>
  <p>For others it is symbolic of Old Guard aesthetic oppression, a stifling cage that hinders the search for expression.</p>

As my reading week(s) continue I came across this fantastic quote in &#8220;Making and Breaking the Grid&#8221; written by Timothy Samara.

I have been reading books about traditional layout design, a topic that can inform my research into design for the mobile web. I have often avoided grids because the strict proportions that can inhibit some types of design, but I have found since graduating from my undergraduate degree and working in a quick paced industry that grids can streamline the design process.

Using a tried and tested grid as a foundation for a website can ultimately lead to a better and more robust design. A grid is a list of rules to follow to create an aesthetic yet functional design.
