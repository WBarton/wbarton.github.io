HTML5 offers some great features like the canvas tag giving way to a plethora of animation options never thought possible. When IE9 was being released Microsoft Corp and  Parisian studio [Steaw Web Design][1] created &#8216;[Never Mind The Bullets][2]&#8216; a HTML5 parallax powered web comic.

In addition to the aforementioned canvas tag, &#8216;Never Mind The Bullets&#8217; utilises Font face loading, 2D transform, Multi-Background and the audio tag. These techniques come together to create a great multimedia interactive narrative.
