      <p>While researching and working on a project for a client I have deided on a few things regrading responsive web design. This is my current opinion and no doubt it will change; as it often does.</p>

<p>Responsive web design is not the perfect method to take a website and make it look amazing for every device. It is used to bridge the gaps between viewport sizes, a lot like fluid layouts did except it is taken further.</p>

<p>We want to design websites that change depending on the width of the device it is viewed on not just for making a site that scales nicely for mobile devices.</p>

<p><strong>It is called responsive web design not mobile web design.</strong></p>
