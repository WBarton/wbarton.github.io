<p>Could colour be used differently? By having recently viewed categories appear more saturated and categories that have not been viewed for some time appear less-saturated. Could sound be used? A different tone for navigation through the different category tiers. Or even haptic feed back. a user could move their finger around screen hot topics causing vibrations like hot and cold but with different vibrate strengths.</p>

<p>I investigated further and came across this TED talk by Fabian Hemmert at TEDxBerlin filmed in February 2010. he speaks about a device that can change its centre of gravity to give feedback or to change its shape and thickness giving the user a tactile interaction to virtual content. He goes as far as to say, why can’t a phone be living with a breath and a heartbeat.</p>
