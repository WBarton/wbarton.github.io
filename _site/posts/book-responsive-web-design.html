<h4 id="what-are-responsive-web-sites"> What are responsive web sites?</h4>

<p>Responsive websites are designed to change depending on the device it is displayed on and the size of the browser window.</p>

<p>The book details techniques that can be put to use to create responsive websites, which in my opinion is the next logical step in web design. With the influx of smaller screen devices such as tablets and smart phones designers have to cater for this growing market, some professionals choose to have to designs one for desktop and another for mobile. But because of middle of the road devices like tablets that offer more real estate but would be hard pushed to display a full scale website as intended responsive web design fills the gap.</p>
