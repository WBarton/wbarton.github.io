<p>Apps are still relevant and will continue to be, except they are becoming less native; utilising modern web development techniques.<br />
In an interview forThe linkeIn app is created with HTML5 and node.js and. Claims they claim that only 5% is Is native.<br />
In an article on Venture Beats written by Jolie O’Dell that contains snippets from an interview with Kiran Prasad the head of the development team at LinkedIn said “You can’t take a mobile app and just scale it up to tablet or desktop,” Which is true an app gives a better mobile experience. He continues by saying “A lot of responsive design is building one site that works everywhere, and that works for websites. But it’s bad for apps… You have to come up with a completely different design because of the use case.”</p>

<p>Apps will not disappear but responsive website have become more app-like in their appearance when viewed on mobile devices.</p>
