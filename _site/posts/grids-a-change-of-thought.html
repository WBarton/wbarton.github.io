</blockquote>

<p>As my reading week(s) continue I came across this fantastic quote in “Making and Breaking the Grid” written by Timothy Samara.</p>

<p>I have been reading books about traditional layout design, a topic that can inform my research into design for the mobile web. I have often avoided grids because the strict proportions that can inhibit some types of design, but I have found since graduating from my undergraduate degree and working in a quick paced industry that grids can streamline the design process.</p>

<p>Using a tried and tested grid as a foundation for a website can ultimately lead to a better and more robust design. A grid is a list of rules to follow to create an aesthetic yet functional design.</p>
