      <p>When designing for print the designer has control over almost every detail. Colours can be chosen from a Pantone colour book that the majority if not all printers use as a standard. The layout of the text, quality of the images and size of the work is the same on each copy.</p>

<p>The print designer has exquisite control down to the thickness, texture and colour paper it is printed on. Web designers don’t get this control the final product can be view on a plethora of devices with a wide range of screen sizes that could have different colour calibrations.</p>

<p>Browsers also change how websites are displayed, HTML and CSS are often rendered differently. This makes cross browser compatibility an aim for front-end web designers but could we not ask for more why can’t we the web design community ask for exquisite design control.</p>
