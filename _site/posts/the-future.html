      <p>Native versus web based apps… In my opinion the versatility of web based apps are far superior than native apps, the ability to easily deploy the app to a variety of devices is ideal for developers.</p>

<p>With HTML5 having a new storage specification allowing more information to be saved off line on the device, new possibilities are opened when it comes to using the app offline to read a news story for example.</p>

<p>The presentation below by Peter-Paul Koch highlights the need for an improved security structure before the mobile web can reach its true potential. I had not thought of this and have decided that this updated structure would need to be put in place, on web browsers on certain website both on mobile and static a website may ask to use you location; great for finding a near by shop or coffee house. But, until the a secure API (<em>application programming interface</em>) is put in place as Koch mentions the mobile web will fail to perform the way it is hoped it some day will.</p>
